----------------------
Section 0: Student Introduction:
Before taking this programming course I have taken two Java Courses equivalent to a year of Java
programming at university here (https://java-programming.mooc.fi/). You can see my certificates for
this here (https://github.com/AdamMcCarthyCS/adammccarthycs/tree/main/certificates).

While I was able to write the program without much difficulty, I used this project to practice
writing professional javadocs and use Git versioning effectively for future projects. I am
learning new material on the course as some of what I had previously studied was outdated.
I enjoy the programming labs, lectures, and links to extra material to read, such as the article
from the first lecture about how the Java Virtual Machine works.

Reflection Outline:
TODO: Add javadocs folder
Section 1: Where selection/iteration used
------------------------------
In this section I will proceed by first going through the CarPurchaserHelper class from top to
bottom, followed by going through the Driver class from top to bottom.


CarPurchaserHelper.java
-----------------------
CarPurchaserHelper::calculateHP
SELECTION: An if/else conditional statement is used to determine whether to include compound
interest is used in the calculation of the monthly payment (lines 41-52)
ITERATION: In the else block of the conditional statement a for loop is used to calculate
the factor (1 + monthlyInterestRate)^n. That is, factor = (1 + r) * (1 + r) * ... * (1 + r), n times.
(lines 46-48)

CarPurchaserHelper::pcpResultMonth
SELECTION: An if/else conditional statement is used to determine whether to include compound
interest is used in the calculation of the monthly payment. (lines 92 - 102)
ITERATION: In the else block of the conditional statement a for loop is used to calculate
the factor (1 + monthlyInterestRate)^n. That is, factor = (1 + r) * (1 + r) * ... * (1 + r), n times.
(lines 97 - 99)

CarPurchaserHelper::recommendCarType
SELECTION: An if/else-if/else-if/else conditional statement is used in this method to hardcode
the name of the car, its deposit percentage for HP and PCP, and the number of kilometers
travelled per week, based on the lifestyle choice that the user has made. These are the only
arguments that change when calling the calculateHP and pcpResultMonth methods. (lines 232 - 254)


Driver.java
-----------
Driver::start
SELECTION: if the choice variable returned from the chooseMenuItem method is -1 then a warning
message is printed to the user telling them they have made an invalid selection in the looping
menu (lines 79 - 81)
ITERATION: The while loop that controls the programs main menu has a sentinel value of -1 which
starts the loop. The user is asked to make a choice from the options which is then passed to the
chooseMenuItem method. Once the program has finished completing the logic from the menu choice
control is passed back to the while loop. If the user has chosen exit then the choice value is
set to 0 which causes the exit of the while loop, and as a result the program finishes.
(lines 58 - 82)

Driver::chooseMenuItem
SELECTION: The menu choice the user has made is dealt with in a if/else-if block here. Valid
choices are passed to helper functions to carry out the logic for the menu option. I chose to
use this apporach rather than have one massive main method which would in my opinion have been
a nightmare to maintain and debug. If the user chooses 6 to exit, 0 is returned which leads to
the program exiting, there is also validation here as if any number besides 1-6 is entered
the user is informed via the start method that they have made an invalid choice.
    This approach makes it very straightforward to add new menu options later also. Just add another
if-else condition and method to the class, then update the printed menu. (lines 104 - 125)

Section 3: How PCP/HP were understood and used
-----------------------------------
In this section I will explain how the calculateHP and pcpResultMonth methods work and are used

CarPurchaserHelper::calculateHP
------------------------------
How the method works:
(1) The calculateHP method takes arguments representing the car price, depoist, APR, and hire-purchase
duration.
(2) It then calculates the amount to finance by subtracting the deposit from the car price giving
the outstanding balance on the car.
(3) The monthly interest rate is calculated by dividing the integer annual interest rate by 100,
which turns it into a multiplier between 0 and 1 and divides this by 12 to give the monthly interest
multiplier.
(4) The total number of monthly payments is calculated by multiplying the number of years by 12 (months)
(5) The program control flow splits into two parts
    (a) If the monthly interest rate is 0% then the amount to finance (2) is divided by the total
    number of months, giving the monthly repayment, which is returned, ending the method call.
    (b1) If the monthly interest rate is greater than 0% then starting with a factor of 1, the
    factor is multiplied by 1 + monthly interest multiplier and updated for each month of the
    hire-purchase term. This results in the interest rate compounding, and each iteration of the
    compounding process includes calculating interest on the interest rate generated in the previous
    iteration. This results in a factor, which multiplied by the amount to finance, gives the
    total amount which will need to be repaid and includes the initial amount to finance and all
    interest generated during the hire-purchase term.
    (b2) Finally the monthly payment is calculated using by the formula:
    monthly payment = amount to finance * monthly interest rate * factor / (factor - 1)
    This is then returned by the method

How the method is used:
Use 1: When the user selects calculate HP (Driver::start - line 63), control of the program is passed to
the Driver::calculateHP method (Driver - line 141) which calls the CarPurchaserHelper::calculateHP method
(CarPurchaserHelper - line 36)
Use 2: When the user selects Recommend Car Type (Driver::start - line 67), control of the program is
passed to the Driver::recommendedCarChoice method (Driver - line 287). This calls the
CarPurchaserHelper::recommendCarType method (CarPurchaserHelper - line 210) which in turn uses the
CarPurchaserHelper::calculateHP method (CarPurchaserHelper - line 36) to calculate the monthly
hire-purchase payment (CarPurchaserHelper - line 256) and prints it as part of its recommendations based on the user's lifestyle.


CarPurchaserHelper::pcpResultMonth
----------------------------------
How the method works:
(1) The pcpResultMonth takes arguments representing the car price, deposit amount, APR, contract term
in years, and guaranteed minimum future value at the end of the contract
(2) The guaranteed minimum future value is calculated by turning the gmfvPercent into a multiplier
which is multiplied by the car price to give the future value at the end of the contract.
(3) The amount to finance is calcualte by subtracting the deposit and guaranteed minimum future value
from the original car price.
(4) The monthly interest rate is calcualted by dividing the integer percentage value by 100 to change
it to a multiplier, then dividing the result by 12 to find out the value of the multiplier for a single
month.
(5) The total number of months is calculated by multiplying the number of years by 12 (months).
(6) A double variable is created to store the monthly payment which will be the methods return value.
(7) The program control flow breaks into two separate paths
    (7a) If the monthly interest rate is 0% then the monthly payments are calculated by dividing the
    car price by the number of months and returning this value.
    (7b1) If the monthly interest rate is greater than 0% then starting with a factor of 1, the
    factor is multiplied by 1 + monthly interest multiplier and updated for each month of the
    personal contract plan term. This results in the interest rate compounding, and each iteration
    of the compounding process includes calculating interest on the interest rate generated in the
    previous iteration. This results in a factor, which multiplied by the amount to finance, gives
    the total amount which will need to be repaid and includes the initial amount to finance and all
    interest generated during the personal contract payment term.
    (7b2) Finally the monthly payment is calculated using by the formula:
    monthly payment = amount to finance * monthly interest rate * factor / (factor - 1)
    This is then returned by the method.

How the method is used:
Use 1: When the user selects calculate PCP (Driver::start - line 64), control of the program is passed to
the Driver::calculatePCP method (Driver - line 179) which calls the
CarPurchaserHelper::pcpResultMonth method (CarPurchaserHelper - line 83)
Use 2: When the user selects Recommend Car Type (Driver::start - line 67), control of the program is
passed to the Driver::recommendedCarChoice method (Driver - line 287). This calls the
CarPurchaserHelper::recommendCarType method (CarPurchaserHelper - line 210) which in turn uses the
CarPurchaserHelper::pcpResultMonth method (CarPurchaserHelper - line 83) to calculate the monthly
personal contract plan payment (CarPurchaserHelper - line 258) and prints it as part of its recommendations based on the user's
lifestyle.

Section 4: Coding process
TODO: Write Chronology of project
(1) I initially created a git repository for the project and implemented the printWelcomeMessage and
printGoodbyeMessage methods along with the calculateMonthlyCost and fuelCostEstimator methods.
(2) I then created an instance of the CarPurchaserHelper class in the Driver class and implemented
the menu, hp calculation, pcp calculation, fuel cost, monthly repayment and program exit logic.
(3) I then implemented the car recommendation method in the CarPurchaserHelper class and formatted
its string output so the numerical values would be printed to 2dp, the expected format for monetary
values.
(4) I then decided that instead of having a single huge main method performing all of the menu control
logic, I would refactor the Driver class to be a simple main method starting the program, a start
method which prints and controls the program menu loop, and a chooseMenuItem method which delegates
control flow to helper methods which perform each of the menu's 6 choices. The idea behind this is
that it separated the concerns in the program, makes it easy to add new items, makes it easy to
debug any issues due to the uncoupling of the different parts of the program logic and if
the program were to be tested it would make that process easier as the structure of the logic would
become more modular.
(5) I then went through the CarPurchaserHelper and Driver class and wrote javadoc style documentation
for all methods in the class. My idea here was to be able to generate interactive javadocs to go along
with the project of the same type as you can find on the Oracle java documentation. A developer
familiar with java would then be able to look at my project documentation in a way that is familiar
with their day-to-day workflow.
(6) I then wrote the readme, including user instructions, program description and problems with the
implementation
(7) I added a method to calculate the balloon payment and updated the output in the Driver class for
that option (a process made very straightforward by my refactoring in step (4).
(8) At this point the program logic was completed and I wrote the reflection detailing, the use of
iteration and selection, methods, their parameters and return values, how the pcp and hp methods work
and where they are used, and the chronology of the project to date, and ...


Section 5: Challenges
TODO: Write challenges
(1) The first issue I had when completing the project was that the formatting of the double outputs
of my calculation methods in the CarPurchaserHelper class were not rounded to two decimal places. I
saw three possible solutions to this.
    (a) I could round the outputs using the Math.round() method from the java.lang library. This has
    been explained in the README.md. The basic idea is that I would have either rounded each value
    in each method before returning it or implemented a helper function to round the values. I felt
    that this would obscure the logic of each individual method by coupling it with another method or
    the Math class which we have so far not used on the course.
    (b) I could use the String.format() method to round the values to two decimal places at any place
    where the values were returned or printed. Although this causes some unnecessary repetition we
    have spent significant time in the course discussing the String class and I felt it was keeping
    more with what has been taught in the lectures. Although the format method wasn't specifically
    mentioned the Oracle docs and online tutorials show how the method can be easily used for
    rounding of doubles.

(2) The second issue that I had was related to refactoring the main method into several static helper
methods. I had to pass the Scanner and CarPurchaserHelper objects as arguments into each of the helper
methods that I created. This felt a little forced to me. I would have preferred to have both of
those instances created in main as class fields so the static methods would not be reliant on passed
instances to carry out their functionality. However, to solve this the way I really wanted to would
require me to have fields in the Driver class which contain the Scanner and CarPurchaserHelper
instances. That way I would not have to pass them through the method calls. However, as we have not
covered OOP yet, I wanted to implement a solution that used the procedural approach to programming we
have taken so far on the course.

Section 6: Main Learnings
The main learnings I had during this project were the use of the format method in the String class
and the separation of concerns in methods.
    String formating is a very useful thing to know for printing neat displays in future projects. I was aware of the
old C-style formatting for strings but not how to use it in Java. I also got to know some of the other
the different characters to represent number types in this syntax. Examples are: f for a decimal number
d for a decimal integer, C for a Unicode character.
    I practiced separating the massive main method into smaller independent methods which I consider
as practicing writing cleaner code which can be easily extended, maintained and tested. I found that
this was in fact the case when I added the functionality to calculate the balloon payment and was able
to easily implement the change in ten minutes without breaking the program or creating any unexpected
side effects. This was mostly because I could quickly identify the parts of the program which would
be affected by the change and convince myself that the logic there was independent of other parts of
the program.

TODO: check program options all work in both
TODO: Mark work and add references showing evidence for marking
Part A - Comments/Indention etc (x / 9)
-----------------------------

comments (1 / 1) - The program is extensively commented with both in method comments and javadoc
comments throughout describing the methods and classes involved in both the CarPurchaserHelper and
Driver classes
---
formatting (2 / 2) - The code in both the files has been formatted by selecting the code menu in the
menu bar and then choosing Auto-Indent lines. This can be seen in the CarPurchaserHelper.java and
Driver.java files
---
naming (2 / 2) - All methods that I was allowed to name use camel case format and are verb names
that are meant to be descriptive and self-documenting.
Examples in the CarPurchaserHelper class are:
calculateBalloonPayment (line 120), printWelcomeMessage (line 127), and recommendCarType (line 205)
Examples in the Driver class are:
start (line 55), chooseMenuItem (line 102), calculateFuelCost (line 222), recommendCarChoice (line 287)
---
structure of code (0 / 2) - I believe that by separating my Driver class into many static methods I
have made the program easier to debug, extend, and maintain. However, I assume that the expected
behaviour was to have one giant main method with all the functionality inside so in that respect I
did not do what was asked. If I was writing the program for my own purposes I would not change what
I have done.

All other methods written   (15 / 20)
I will list all the methods of the CarPurchaserHelper class in the order that the TODOs were given
in the skeleton project and the lines they can be found:

CarPurchaserHelper methods
--------------------------
CarPurchaserHelper::printWelcomeMessage (lines 124 - 130)
CarPurchaserHelper::printGoodbyeMessage (lines 132 - 138)
CarPurchaserHelper::calculateMonthlyCost (lines 140 - 161)
CarPurchaserHelper::fuelCostEstimator (lines 163 - 186)
CarPurchaserHelper::recommendCarType (lines 188 - 290)

Driver methods
--------------
In the Driver class I refactored the main method which originally contained all the program logic
(see commit 9820e7bf Driver class for how it originally looked)

This resulted in the methods:
Driver::main (lines 15 - 42)
Driver::start (lines 44 - 83)
Driver::chooseMenuItem (lines 85 - 125)
Driver::calculateHP (lines 127 - 162)
Driver::calculatePCP (lines 164 - 208)
Driver::calculateFuelCost (lines 210 - 237)
Driver::calculateMonthlyCost (lines 239 -270)
Driver::recommendCarChoice (lines 272 - 297)

I will give myself 15/20 as you probably wanted the entire program logic written in the main method,
but I do not feel this is a good idea. The reason is if something breaks it would be a nightmare to
find what is wrong. As a general rule, I try to break program logic up into smaller blocks, so that I
can easily change, extend, or debug the program without it being an ordeal. I learned this lesson the
hard way from staring at python code for ages and being afraid to touch anything because the errors
kept compounding when I did. I worked through the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs" (the wizard book!) by Ableton and Sussman a few years ago which teaches functional
programming. Ever since that, my programs have been more modular and less of a headache!

Part D - Driver	 (X /36)

        - functionality to exit loop (and hence program) - returning 0 from
        Driver::chooseMenuItem (lines 119 - 120) updates choice variable in Driver::start to 0
        which causes the loop to exit.
   - all methods created in CarPurchaseHelper called and used correctly (10 /10)
   I will list all the uses of the CarPurchaserHelper methods in the Driver class from top to bottom
   below:
   - CarPurchaserHelper constructor called to create an instance of the class (line 29)
   - printWelcomeMessage called to generate welcome string for printing (line 33)
   - printGoodbyeMessage called to generate exit string for printing (line 40)

   - pcpResultMonth called to calculate personal contract plan montly payment (line 195)
   - fuelCostEstimator called to calculate an estimate of weekly fuel cost (line 231)
   - calculateMonthlyCost called to calculate the monthly repayments of a 0% interest plan (line 263)
   - recommendCarType called to return a car recommendation based on lifestyle (line 294)
