----------------------
Student Introduction:
Before taking this programming course I have taken two Java Courses equivalent to a year of Java
programming at university here (https://java-programming.mooc.fi/). You can see my certificates for
this here (https://github.com/AdamMcCarthyCS/adammccarthycs/tree/main/certificates).

While I was able to write the program without much difficulty, I used this project to practice
writing professional javadocs and use Git versioning effectively for future projects. I am
learning new material on the course as some of what I had previously studied was outdated.
I enjoy the programming labs, lectures, and links to extra material to read, such as the article
from the first lecture about how the Java Virtual Machine works.

Reflection Outline:

Where selection/iteration used

Methods with parameters and return values

How PCP/HP were understood and used

Main difficulties I came across in your development of solution and how I solved them.

Any bugs remaining in the solution or unfinished elements of spec (no need if you have detailed these in the rubric section)

Main learnings from my engagement with assignment

Mandatory : PLease list any references used in your development/ implementation of your submission.

Please consider the following statements and choose one (delete the inappropriate one)

- This is my work apart from the specific references noted above (and any code from class notes). I understand the code and can decribe any parts of the solution if needs be;

- This is not all my own work - I'm not sure I understand what I am submitting.

-----------------------------
Please list the following for each extra functionality that you implemented
     the extra functionality
     what changes this lead to from spec given
     where the extra implementation took place.
