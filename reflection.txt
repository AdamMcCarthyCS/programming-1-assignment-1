Section 0: Student Introduction:
Before taking this programming course I have taken two Java Courses equivalent to a year of Java
programming at university here (https://java-programming.mooc.fi/). You can see my certificates for
this here (https://github.com/AdamMcCarthyCS/adammccarthycs/tree/main/certificates).

While I was able to write the program without much difficulty, I used this project to practice
writing professional javadocs and use Git versioning effectively for future projects. I am
learning new material on the course as some of what I had previously studied was outdated.
I enjoy the programming labs, lectures, and links to extra material to read, such as the article
from the first lecture about how the Java Virtual Machine works.

Reflection Outline:
TODO: Add javadocs folder
Section 1: Where selection/iteration used
------------------------------
In this section I will proceed by first going through the CarPurchaserHelper class from top to
bottom, followed by going through the Driver class from top to bottom.


CarPurchaserHelper.java
-----------------------
CarPurchaserHelper::calculateHP
SELECTION: An if/else conditional statement is used to determine whether to include compound
interest is used in the calculation of the monthly payment (lines 41-52)
ITERATION: In the else block of the conditional statement a for loop is used to calculate
the factor (1 + monthlyInterestRate)^n. That is, factor = (1 + r) * (1 + r) * ... * (1 + r), n times.
(lines 46-48)

CarPurchaserHelper::pcpResultMonth
SELECTION: An if/else conditional statement is used to determine whether to include compound
interest is used in the calculation of the monthly payment. (lines 92 - 102)
ITERATION: In the else block of the conditional statement a for loop is used to calculate
the factor (1 + monthlyInterestRate)^n. That is, factor = (1 + r) * (1 + r) * ... * (1 + r), n times.
(lines 97 - 99)

CarPurchaserHelper::recommendCarType
SELECTION: An if/else-if/else-if/else conditional statement is used in this method to hardcode
the name of the car, its deposit percentage for HP and PCP, and the number of kilometers
travelled per week, based on the lifestyle choice that the user has made. These are the only
arguments that change when calling the calculateHP and pcpResultMonth methods. (lines 232 - 254)


Driver.java
-----------
Driver::start
SELECTION: if the choice variable returned from the chooseMenuItem method is -1 then a warning
message is printed to the user telling them they have made an invalid selection in the looping
menu (lines 79 - 81)
ITERATION: The while loop that controls the programs main menu has a sentinel value of -1 which
starts the loop. The user is asked to make a choice from the options which is then passed to the
chooseMenuItem method. Once the program has finished completing the logic from the menu choice
control is passed back to the while loop. If the user has chosen exit then the choice value is
set to 0 which causes the exit of the while loop, and as a result the program finishes.
(lines 58 - 82)

Driver::chooseMenuItem
SELECTION: The menu choice the user has made is dealt with in a if/else-if block here. Valid
choices are passed to helper functions to carry out the logic for the menu option. I chose to
use this apporach rather than have one massive main method which would in my opinion have been
a nightmare to maintain and debug. If the user chooses 6 to exit, 0 is returned which leads to
the program exiting, there is also validation here as if any number besides 1-6 is entered
the user is informed via the start method that they have made an invalid choice.
    This approach makes it very straightforward to add new menu options later also. Just add another
if-else condition and method to the class, then update the printed menu. (lines 104 - 125)

Section 3: How PCP/HP were understood and used
-----------------------------------
In this section I will explain how the calculateHP and pcpResultMonth methods work and are used

CarPurchaserHelper::calculateHP
------------------------------
How the method works:
(1) The calculateHP method takes arguments representing the car price, depoist, APR, and hire-purchase
duration.
(2) It then calculates the amount to finance by subtracting the deposit from the car price giving
the outstanding balance on the car.
(3) The monthly interest rate is calculated by dividing the integer annual interest rate by 100,
which turns it into a multiplier between 0 and 1 and divides this by 12 to give the monthly interest
multiplier.
(4) The total number of monthly payments is calculated by multiplying the number of years by 12 (months)
(5) The program control flow splits into two parts
    (a) If the monthly interest rate is 0% then the amount to finance (2) is divided by the total
    number of months, giving the monthly repayment, which is returned, ending the method call.
    (b1) If the monthly interest rate is greater than 0% then starting with a factor of 1, the
    factor is multiplied by 1 + monthly interest multiplier and updated for each month of the
    hire-purchase term. This results in the interest rate compounding, and each iteration of the
    compounding process includes calculating interest on the interest rate generated in the previous
    iteration. This results in a factor, which multiplied by the amount to finance, gives the
    total amount which will need to be repaid and includes the initial amount to finance and all
    interest generated during the hire-purchase term.
    (b2) Finally the monthly payment is calculated using by the formula:
    monthly payment = amount to finance * monthly interest rate * factor / (factor - 1)
    This is then returned by the method

How the method is used:
Use 1: When the user selects calculate HP (Driver::start - line 63), control of the program is passed to
the Driver::calculateHP method (Driver - line 141) which calls the CarPurchaserHelper::calculateHP method
(CarPurchaserHelper - line 36)
Use 2: When the user selects Recommend Car Type (Driver::start - line 67), control of the program is
passed to the Driver::recommendedCarChoice method (Driver - line 287). This calls the
CarPurchaserHelper::recommendCarType method (CarPurchaserHelper - line 210) which in turn uses the
CarPurchaserHelper::calculateHP method (CarPurchaserHelper - line 36) to calculate the monthly
hire-purchase payment (CarPurchaserHelper - line 256) and prints it as part of its recommendations based on the user's lifestyle.


CarPurchaserHelper::pcpResultMonth
----------------------------------
How the method works:
(1) The pcpResultMonth takes arguments representing the car price, deposit amount, APR, contract term
in years, and guaranteed minimum future value at the end of the contract
(2) The guaranteed minimum future value is calculated by turning the gmfvPercent into a multiplier
which is multiplied by the car price to give the future value at the end of the contract.
(3) The amount to finance is calcualte by subtracting the deposit and guaranteed minimum future value
from the original car price.
(4) The monthly interest rate is calcualted by dividing the integer percentage value by 100 to change
it to a multiplier, then dividing the result by 12 to find out the value of the multiplier for a single
month.
(5) The total number of months is calculated by multiplying the number of years by 12 (months).
(6) A double variable is created to store the monthly payment which will be the methods return value.
(7) The program control flow breaks into two separate paths
    (7a) If the monthly interest rate is 0% then the monthly payments are calculated by dividing the
    car price by the number of months and returning this value.
    (7b1) If the monthly interest rate is greater than 0% then starting with a factor of 1, the
    factor is multiplied by 1 + monthly interest multiplier and updated for each month of the
    personal contract plan term. This results in the interest rate compounding, and each iteration
    of the compounding process includes calculating interest on the interest rate generated in the
    previous iteration. This results in a factor, which multiplied by the amount to finance, gives
    the total amount which will need to be repaid and includes the initial amount to finance and all
    interest generated during the personal contract payment term.
    (7b2) Finally the monthly payment is calculated using by the formula:
    monthly payment = amount to finance * monthly interest rate * factor / (factor - 1)
    This is then returned by the method.

How the method is used:
Use 1: When the user selects calculate PCP (Driver::start - line 64), control of the program is passed to
the Driver::calculatePCP method (Driver - line 179) which calls the
CarPurchaserHelper::pcpResultMonth method (CarPurchaserHelper - line 83)
Use 2: When the user selects Recommend Car Type (Driver::start - line 67), control of the program is
passed to the Driver::recommendedCarChoice method (Driver - line 287). This calls the
CarPurchaserHelper::recommendCarType method (CarPurchaserHelper - line 210) which in turn uses the
CarPurchaserHelper::pcpResultMonth method (CarPurchaserHelper - line 83) to calculate the monthly
personal contract plan payment (CarPurchaserHelper - line 258) and prints it as part of its recommendations based on the user's
lifestyle.
