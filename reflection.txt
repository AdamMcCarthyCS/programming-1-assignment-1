----------------------
Section 0: Student Introduction:
Before taking this programming course I have taken two Java Courses equivalent to a year of Java
programming at university here (https://java-programming.mooc.fi/). You can see my certificates for
this here (https://github.com/AdamMcCarthyCS/adammccarthycs/tree/main/certificates).

While I was able to write the program without much difficulty, I used this project to practice
writing professional javadocs and use Git versioning effectively for future projects. I am
learning new material on the course as some of what I had previously studied was outdated.
I enjoy the programming labs, lectures, and links to extra material to read, such as the article
from the first lecture about how the Java Virtual Machine works.

Reflection Outline:

Section 1: Where selection/iteration used
------------------------------
In this section I will proceed by first going through the CarPurchaserHelper class from top to
bottom, followed by going through the Driver class from top to bottom.

CarPurchaserHelper.java
-----------------------
CarPurchaserHelper::calculateHP
SELECTION: An if/else conditional statement is used to determine whether to include compound
interest is used in the calculation of the monthly payment (lines 41-52)
ITERATION: In the else block of the conditional statement a for loop is used to calculate
the factor (1 + monthlyInterestRate)^n. That is, factor = (1 + r) * (1 + r) * ... * (1 + r), n times.
(lines 46-48)

CarPurchaserHelper::pcpResultMonth
SELECTION: An if/else conditional statement is used to determine whether to include compound
interest is used in the calculation of the monthly payment. (lines 92 - 102)
ITERATION: In the else block of the conditional statement a for loop is used to calculate
the factor (1 + monthlyInterestRate)^n. That is, factor = (1 + r) * (1 + r) * ... * (1 + r), n times.
(lines 97 - 99)

CarPurchaserHelper::recommendCarType
SELECTION: An if/else-if/else-if/else conditional statement is used in this method to hardcode
the name of the car, its deposit percentage for HP and PCP, and the number of kilometers
travelled per week, based on the lifestyle choice that the user has made. These are the only
arguments that change when calling the calculateHP and pcpResultMonth methods. (lines 228 - 250)

Driver.java
-----------

Driver::start
SELECTION: if the choice variable returned from the chooseMenuItem method is -1 then a warning
message is printed to the user telling them they have made an invalid selection in the looping
menu (lines 79 - 81)
ITERATION: The while loop that controls the programs main menu has a sentinel value of -1 which
starts the loop. The user is asked to make a choice from the options which is then passed to the
chooseMenuItem method. Once the program has finished completing the logic from the menu choice
control is passed back to the while loop. If the user has chosen exit then the choice value is
set to 0 which causes the exit of the while loop, and as a result the program finishes.
(lines 58 - 82)

Driver::chooseMenuItem
SELECTION: The menu choice the user has made is dealt with in a if/else-if block here. Valid
choices are passed to helper functions to carry out the logic for the menu option. I chose to
use this apporach rather than have one massive main method which would in my opinion have been
a nightmare to maintain and debug. If the user chooses 6 to exit, 0 is returned which leads to
the program exiting, there is also validation here as if any number besides 1-6 is entered
the user is informed via the start method that they have made an invalid choice.
    This approach makes it very straightforward to add new menu options later also. Just add another
if-else condition and method to the class, then update the printed menu.
